## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository contains the two main components of the Vouse platform:

*   **`vouse_flutter/`**: The cross-platform mobile client built with Flutter.
    *   ➡️ [**Go to Flutter Client README**](vouse_flutter/README.md)
*   **`vouse_server/`**: The backend API server built with NestJS.
    *   ➡️ [**Go to Server README**](vouse_server/README.md)

## 🏛️ Architecture

Vouse employs a client-server architecture:
*   The **Flutter client** provides the user interface, leveraging **Riverpod** for state management and following **Clean Architecture** principles (Domain, Data, Presentation layers). It interacts with the backend API via a **Retrofit/Dio** client and handles local data persistence and secure storage.
*   The **NestJS server** handles core business logic, data persistence (PostgreSQL via **TypeORM**), background jobs (Redis via **BullMQ**), and communication with external services (Firebase, Twitter API). It uses a **modular design** based on NestJS conventions.

*(See individual READMEs for more detailed architecture information)*
